# Next Steps

## Road to "OWASP Top 10 Insider Threats - 2026"
To further improve the quality and significance of the OWASP Top 10 Insider Threats, we plan to expand the dataset to evaluate the top 10.
We plan to perform a CVE and CWE analysis for the next version.
Additionally, we want to make an open call for data over 2024 and 2025.
We invite you to join our Open Call for Data for 2024 and 2025. There, you will be able to donate data, anonymously or namely, to the Project. 2024 and 2025, we will collect all the data and then process it for 2026. This way, we plan to publish the OWASP Top 10 Insider Threats - Version 2026 using a more extensive dataset and further improve the quality and significance.
Contributors and donors will be listed as sponsors, if they wish so, on the related project pages.
