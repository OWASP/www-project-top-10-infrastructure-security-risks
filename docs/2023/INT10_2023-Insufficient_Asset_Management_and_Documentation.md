# INT10:2023 â€“ Insufficient Asset Management and Documentation

## Description
Insufficient asset management refers to the shortcomings in an organization's ability to accurately identify, track, and document all its hardware and software assets, as well as the associated configurations, dependencies, and lifecycles. It encompasses the lack of an organized and up-to-date inventory of IT assets, which is essential for effective security, compliance, and operational efficiency. It enables an easy and fast mapping of affected resources and an accurate incident response. 
## Risk
An accurate asset list and corresponding documentation are crucial for overall security. A lack of documentation increases the likelihood of unauthorized or unmanaged devices and software within the network, making it difficult to enforce security policies and monitor for vulnerabilities effectively. Secondly, it hampers incident response capabilities, as the organization may struggle to identify the scope and impact of a security incident or breach. Compliance with industry regulations and internal policies becomes challenging, exposing the organization to legal and financial liabilities. Finally, it leads to inefficient resource allocation, often resulting in overspending on redundant assets or underinvesting in critical IT infrastructure. Insufficient asset management and documentation significantly threaten an organization's security, compliance, cost-effectiveness, and operational resilience.
## Rectification
To mitigate the risks, organizations should implement a comprehensive asset management program. This program should include the following key components:

1. Asset Inventory: Develop and maintain a complete inventory of all hardware and software assets, including servers, workstations, mobile devices, applications, and network equipment. Continuously update this inventory to reflect changes in the environment.
2. Asset Classification: Categorize assets based on their criticality and function. This classification helps prioritize security measures and resource allocation. 
3. Lifecycle Management: Implement a systematic approach to asset lifecycle management, including procurement, deployment, maintenance, and disposal. Ensure that outdated or retired assets are securely decommissioned or renewed before they lead to a security risk.
4. Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits and reconciliation of the asset inventory to identify discrepancies and ensure accuracy. This also includes regular vulnerability scanning cycles to detect affected assets and mitigate security risks.
5. Process, Responsibility and Implementation Documentation: Provide an accurate list of documents describing all IT- and business processes, the corresponding responsibilities and technical details.

By establishing a robust asset management program, organizations can enhance their security posture, improve compliance, optimize resource allocation, and streamline operations, ultimately reducing the overall risk.

## Example Attack Scenarios
**Scenario #1: Undetected Vulnerabilities**
Over time, an organization has amassed a vast and complex IT infrastructure, including servers, network devices, and a multitude of software applications. Due to a lack of systematic vulnerability scanning and asset management, the IT team is unaware of the accumulating security weaknesses within their environment. This oversight exposes the company to potential cyber threats, as attackers can exploit these undetected vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or exfiltrate sensitive data. As the organization expands, the risk associated with these undetected vulnerabilities grows, underscoring the pressing need for a comprehensive vulnerability management program to proactively identify, prioritize, and remediate these weaknesses.

**Scenario #2: Incident Response**
An incident response team is confronted with a critical security breach. Attackers have successfully exploited an undisclosed software vulnerability in the corporate platform, causing a significant service disruption. The investigation reveals that the attacker compromised the platform's webservers, creating an entry point to the internal network. To prevent further damage to corporate value, the incident response team focuses on the critical assets that could easily identified by the asset management. Due to the accurate and up-to-date documentation, all critical systems weaknesses could identified and defended easily without significant data breaches and damaged systems rebuild.
